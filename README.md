# AliveEmotions
Shows emotions that are transmitted by other users of the app.
Created as a prototype for the alive semester project done for h_da (Hochschule Darmstadt).

## How to use
1. Clone or download the directory onto your computer and run the XCWorkspace.
2. The project consists of the first prototype of alive which outputs emotions as emojis and the second protototype that makes use of the Core Animation framework to draw and animate the emotions the way the team intended.
3. To change between the two, just check or uncheck the property "hidden" of "faceViewContainer" in the "Show Emoji View Controller Scene".
